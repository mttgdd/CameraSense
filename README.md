CameraSense
===========

A small application to record video and sensor data from an iphone 5 in real-time.

It was designed for iOS 7 so there might be a few tweaks which need to be made to get it to run on newer versions of iOS.

If you use it for research please cite it, otherwise do with it what you please.
